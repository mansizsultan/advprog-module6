## Reflection 1: Single Threaded Web Server
### 1. Setting Up a TCP Server

To enable communication with a browser, the server must listen for incoming connections. We achieve this using `TcpListener`:

```rust
TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878")
```
This binds the server to `127.0.0.1` on port `7878`.

- `unwrap()` ensures the server exits if an error occurs during startup.
- `for stream in listener.incoming()`
  - Iterates through incoming client connections.
  - Each connection yields a `TcpStream`.
- `let stream = stream.unwrap();`
  - Extracts data from the connection.
  - `unwrap()` ensures a valid connection.
- `println!("Connection established!");`
  - Logs a message when a new connection is received.

### 2. Handling HTTP Requests

The function `handle_connection(stream)` processes client requests. Without this, the server merely acknowledges connections without interpreting HTTP requests.

#### Implementation

```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
```
Accepts a `TcpStream` representing the connection between the client and server.

```rust
let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
```
Uses `BufReader` to facilitate reading the request line by line.

```rust
let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
    .lines()
    .map(|result| result.unwrap())
    .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
    .collect();
```
- `.lines()`: Produces an iterator over input lines.
- `.map(|result| result.unwrap())`: Extracts the text, ignoring errors.
- `.take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())`: Stops reading at the empty line, marking the end of the request headers.
- `.collect()`: Stores the retrieved lines in a `Vec<String>`.

```rust
println!("Request: {:#?}", http_request);
```
Outputs the request details in a structured format.

### Example Output

```powershell
Request: [
    "GET / HTTP/1.1",
    "Host: 127.0.0.1:7878",
    "Connection: keep-alive",
    "Cache-Control: max-age=0",
    "sec-ch-ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"134\", \"Not:A-Brand\";v=\"24\", \"Microsoft Edge\";v=\"134\"",
    "sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0",
    "sec-ch-ua-platform: \"Windows\"",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1",
    "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/134.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/134.0.0.0",
    "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7",
    "Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site",
    "Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate",
    "Sec-Fetch-User: ?1",
    "Sec-Fetch-Dest: document",
    "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd",
    "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,id;q=0.8",
    "Cookie: csrftoken=mhBtv3yLYLjOKKlYzY2WnvtiPAKGyc5z",
]
```

This output provides details such as the HTTP method (`GET`), requested resource (`/`), headers, and accepted data formats.

## Reflection 2: Returning HTML

### Sending HTML Response
The server is now capable of generating structured HTTP responses with HTML content. Instead of just receiving requests, it now replies with a properly formatted response, including a status line, headers, and HTML content loaded from a file.

### Updated `handle_connection()` Implementation

```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&mut stream);
    let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
        .lines()
        .map(|result| result.unwrap())
        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .collect();

    let status_line = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
    let contents = fs::read_to_string("hello.html").unwrap();
    let length = contents.len();
    let response = format!("{status_line}\r\nContent-Length: {length}\r\n\r\n{contents}");
    stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
}
```

This function now:

1. Reads the HTTP request headers.
2. Sets the status line to "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" to indicate a successful response.
3. Loads the `hello.html` file using `fs::read_to_string()`.
4. Determines the content size for the `Content-Length` header.
5. Constructs a complete HTTP response, including the status line, headers, and content.
6. Sends the response back to the client using `stream.write_all()`.

### HTML Content Example

The `hello.html` file contains:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>Hi from Rust, running on this machine.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Enhancements and Current Limitations

At this stage, the server:
- Produces structured HTTP responses containing a status line, headers, and body.
- Serves static HTML content from a file.
- Adheres to HTTP/1.1 by including necessary headers such as `Content-Length`.

However, limitations remain:
- It responds with the same `200 OK` status, regardless of the request path or method.
- Only serves a single HTML file (`hello.html`).
- Lacks error handling (`unwrap()` can crash the program on failure).
- Processes requests sequentially, impacting performance.
- Does not support routing for serving different content based on request paths.

## Reflection 3: Validating Request and Selectively Responding
![Commit 2 screen capture](/assets/images/commit3.png)

In this milestone, the web server has been upgraded to validate incoming requests and dynamically serve different content based on the requested path. By implementing selective response handling, the server now distinguishes between valid and invalid routes, delivering appropriate HTML pages along with correct HTTP status codes.  

#### **Key Enhancements**  

- **Refined Request Processing**  
  The `handle_connection()` function has been updated to extract only the first line of the request (the request line), which includes the HTTP method, path, and version. This optimization eliminates the need to process unnecessary headers.  

- **Efficient Routing Using Pattern Matching**  
  A `match` expression determines the response by mapping request paths to corresponding status codes and HTML files:  
  - A request for `/` (`GET / HTTP/1.1`) results in a `200 OK` response, serving `"hello.html"`.  
  - Any other request returns a `404 NOT FOUND` response, displaying `"404.html"`.  

- **Streamlined Response Generation**  
  Instead of handling status codes and file names separately, the match statement returns a tuple `(status_line, filename)`, simplifying the response construction. The selected file is read, and an HTTP response is formatted with the appropriate headers before being sent to the client.  

#### **Advantages of Refactoring**  

- **Improved Readability**  
  The use of `match` makes the routing logic more concise and eliminates the need for verbose `if-else` statements.  

- **Consistency and Safety**  
  By returning a tuple containing both the status line and filename, the code ensures that related values remain in sync.  

- **Scalability**  
  Adding new routes becomes simpler since the routing logic is centralized in the `match` block, reducing redundancy.  

- **Immutable Variables**  
  The use of immutable bindings aligns with Rustâ€™s best practices, enhancing code safety.  

#### **Current Capabilities and Limitations**  

The server has reached a functional stage where it can:  
* Validate HTTP request formats and extract relevant information  
* Serve different responses based on request paths  
* Return appropriate HTTP status codes (`200 OK` and `404 NOT FOUND`)  
* Load and send HTML files dynamically  

With these enhancements, the server now behaves more like a real web server, paving the way for further improvements in efficiency, error handling, and scalability.
