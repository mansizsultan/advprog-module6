## Reflection 1: Single Threaded Web Server
### **1. Setting Up a TCP Server**

To enable communication with a browser, the server must listen for incoming connections. We achieve this using `TcpListener`:

```rust
TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:7878")
```
This binds the server to `127.0.0.1` on port `7878`.

- `unwrap()` ensures the server exits if an error occurs during startup.
- `for stream in listener.incoming()`
  - Iterates through incoming client connections.
  - Each connection yields a `TcpStream`.
- `let stream = stream.unwrap();`
  - Extracts data from the connection.
  - `unwrap()` ensures a valid connection.
- `println!("Connection established!");`
  - Logs a message when a new connection is received.

### **2. Handling HTTP Requests**

The function `handle_connection(stream)` processes client requests. Without this, the server merely acknowledges connections without interpreting HTTP requests.

#### **Implementation**

```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
```
Accepts a `TcpStream` representing the connection between the client and server.

```rust
let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&stream);
```
Uses `BufReader` to facilitate reading the request line by line.

```rust
let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
    .lines()
    .map(|result| result.unwrap())
    .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
    .collect();
```
- `.lines()`: Produces an iterator over input lines.
- `.map(|result| result.unwrap())`: Extracts the text, ignoring errors.
- `.take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())`: Stops reading at the empty line, marking the end of the request headers.
- `.collect()`: Stores the retrieved lines in a `Vec<String>`.

```rust
println!("Request: {:#?}", http_request);
```
Outputs the request details in a structured format.

### **Example Output**

```powershell
Request: [
    "GET / HTTP/1.1",
    "Host: 127.0.0.1:7878",
    "Connection: keep-alive",
    "Cache-Control: max-age=0",
    "sec-ch-ua: \"Chromium\";v=\"134\", \"Not:A-Brand\";v=\"24\", \"Microsoft Edge\";v=\"134\"",
    "sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0",
    "sec-ch-ua-platform: \"Windows\"",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1",
    "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/134.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/134.0.0.0",
    "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7",
    "Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site",
    "Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate",
    "Sec-Fetch-User: ?1",
    "Sec-Fetch-Dest: document",
    "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd",
    "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,id;q=0.8",
    "Cookie: csrftoken=mhBtv3yLYLjOKKlYzY2WnvtiPAKGyc5z",
]
```

This output provides details such as the HTTP method (`GET`), requested resource (`/`), headers, and accepted data formats.

## Reflection 2: Returning HTML
![Commit 2 screen capture](/assets/images/commit2.png)

### **Sending HTML Response**
The server is now capable of generating structured HTTP responses with HTML content. Instead of just receiving requests, it now replies with a properly formatted response, including a status line, headers, and HTML content loaded from a file.

### **Updated `handle_connection()` Implementation**

```rust
fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf_reader = BufReader::new(&mut stream);
    let http_request: Vec<_> = buf_reader
        .lines()
        .map(|result| result.unwrap())
        .take_while(|line| !line.is_empty())
        .collect();

    let status_line = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
    let contents = fs::read_to_string("hello.html").unwrap();
    let length = contents.len();
    let response = format!("{status_line}\r\nContent-Length: {length}\r\n\r\n{contents}");
    stream.write_all(response.as_bytes()).unwrap();
}
```

This function now:

1. Reads the HTTP request headers.
2. Sets the status line to "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" to indicate a successful response.
3. Loads the `hello.html` file using `fs::read_to_string()`.
4. Determines the content size for the `Content-Length` header.
5. Constructs a complete HTTP response, including the status line, headers, and content.
6. Sends the response back to the client using `stream.write_all()`.

### **HTML Content Example**

The `hello.html` file contains:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>Hi from Rust, running on this machine.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### **Enhancements and Current Limitations**

At this stage, the server:
- Produces structured HTTP responses containing a status line, headers, and body.
- Serves static HTML content from a file.
- Adheres to HTTP/1.1 by including necessary headers such as `Content-Length`.

However, limitations remain:
- It responds with the same `200 OK` status, regardless of the request path or method.
- Only serves a single HTML file (`hello.html`).
- Lacks error handling (`unwrap()` can crash the program on failure).
- Processes requests sequentially, impacting performance.
- Does not support routing for serving different content based on request paths.

## Reflection 3: Validating Request and Selectively Responding
![Commit 2 screen capture](/assets/images/commit3.png)

In this milestone, the web server has been upgraded to validate incoming requests and dynamically serve different content based on the requested path. By implementing selective response handling, the server now distinguishes between valid and invalid routes, delivering appropriate HTML pages along with correct HTTP status codes.  

#### **Key Enhancements**  

- **Refined Request Processing**  
  The `handle_connection()` function has been updated to extract only the first line of the request (the request line), which includes the HTTP method, path, and version. This optimization eliminates the need to process unnecessary headers.  

- **Efficient Routing Using Pattern Matching**  
  A `match` expression determines the response by mapping request paths to corresponding status codes and HTML files:  
  - A request for `/` (`GET / HTTP/1.1`) results in a `200 OK` response, serving `"hello.html"`.  
  - Any other request returns a `404 NOT FOUND` response, displaying `"404.html"`.  

- **Streamlined Response Generation**  
  Instead of handling status codes and file names separately, the match statement returns a tuple `(status_line, filename)`, simplifying the response construction. The selected file is read, and an HTTP response is formatted with the appropriate headers before being sent to the client.  

#### **Advantages of Refactoring**  

- **Improved Readability**  
  The use of `match` makes the routing logic more concise and eliminates the need for verbose `if-else` statements.  

- **Consistency and Safety**  
  By returning a tuple containing both the status line and filename, the code ensures that related values remain in sync.  

- **Scalability**  
  Adding new routes becomes simpler since the routing logic is centralized in the `match` block, reducing redundancy.  

- **Immutable Variables**  
  The use of immutable bindings aligns with Rustâ€™s best practices, enhancing code safety.  

#### **Current Capabilities and Limitations**  

The server has reached a functional stage where it can:  
* Validate HTTP request formats and extract relevant information  
* Serve different responses based on request paths  
* Return appropriate HTTP status codes (`200 OK` and `404 NOT FOUND`)  
* Load and send HTML files dynamically  

With these enhancements, the server now behaves more like a real web server, paving the way for further improvements in efficiency, error handling, and scalability.

## Reflection 4: Simulation Slow Response
### **Handling Single-Threaded Server Limitations**  

Our current web server processes requests sequentially since it runs on a **single-thread**. This means each request must complete before the next one is handled. To demonstrate this limitation, we simulate a delayed response by making the server **sleep for 5 seconds** when accessing `/sleep`:  

```rust
let (status_line, filename) = match &request_line[..] {
    "GET / HTTP/1.1" => ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", "hello.html"),
    "GET /sleep HTTP/1.1" => {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(10));
        ("HTTP/1.1 200 OK", "hello.html")
    }
    _ => ("HTTP/1.1 404 NOT FOUND", "404.html"),
};
```  

Now, if we request `http://127.0.0.1:7878/sleep`, the server pauses for **10 seconds** before responding. Meanwhile, if we open another tab and request `http://127.0.0.1:7878/`, the request **also gets delayed**, proving that the server can only process one request at a time.  

### **Why Does This Happen?**  

- The server runs on a **single execution thread**, meaning it can only handle **one request at a time**.  
- When a request like `/sleep` takes longer to process (due to `thread::sleep()`), the server **pauses completely**, preventing any new requests from being handled.  
- Other requests, even those requiring minimal processing, **must wait** until the ongoing request finishes.  

### **Real-World Impact**  

- In a high-traffic environment, **long-running requests** can cause significant delays for all users.  
- If multiple users request `/sleep`, the server becomes **unresponsive**, leading to **poor user experience**.  
- Even simple requests like accessing `/` will suffer unnecessary delays due to the **blocking nature** of the server.  

### **Solution?**  

To make the server **more efficient**, we need to implement **multi-threading** so that multiple requests can be processed **concurrently**, preventing one slow request from affecting others.

## Reflection 5: Multithreaded Server
At this stage, we have transformed the web server from **single-threaded** to **multi-threaded** using a **ThreadPool**. The main goal of this implementation is to allow the server to handle multiple requests in parallel without creating a new thread for each incoming request.  

### **How ThreadPool Works**  

#### **1. Initializing the ThreadPool**  
When `ThreadPool::new(size)` is called, a fixed number of **Worker** threads are created based on the specified `size`. Each **Worker** has a unique ID and an associated thread that remains idle until a task is assigned by the **ThreadPool**.  

#### **2. Using a Channel for Communication**  
To facilitate communication between the **ThreadPool** and **Workers**, an **mpsc channel** (`mpsc::channel()`) is used. The **sender** is stored in the **ThreadPool** to dispatch tasks, while the **receiver** is shared among all **Workers** via `Arc<Mutex<mpsc::Receiver<Job>>>`. This ensures that multiple **Workers** can access the task queue safely without causing race conditions.  

#### **3. Executing Tasks with `execute(f)`**  
When the server receives a request, the `execute(f)` function is called with a **closure** representing the task. This closure is then wrapped in a `Box<Job>` and sent through the **channel** to be picked up by an available **Worker**.  

#### **4. Workers Processing Tasks**  
A **Worker** retrieves a task from the **receiver** using `receiver.lock().unwrap().recv().unwrap()`, ensuring that only one **Worker** picks up a task at a time. Once the task is received, the **Worker** executes the closure and then waits for the next task.  

By implementing this system, the **ThreadPool** allows the server to process multiple requests simultaneously without the overhead of constantly creating and destroying threads. This improves efficiency and scalability, as the server no longer needs to wait for one request to complete before handling the next. Additionally, reusing existing threads prevents excessive resource consumption and ensures that the server remains responsive under heavy load. By limiting the number of active threads, the **ThreadPool** also helps prevent server overload when dealing with a high volume of incoming requests.

## Bonus Reflection: Function Improvement
In this milestone, I've improved the **ThreadPool** implementation by introducing a `build` function, providing better error handling and flexibility when creating a thread pool. This follows Rust's best practices and enhances reliability.  

#### **Key Enhancements:**  

1. **Error Handling with `Result`**  
   - `build(size: usize) -> Result<ThreadPool, PoolCreationError>`  
   - Returns `Result` instead of panicking, allowing graceful error handling  

2. **Custom Error Type**  
   - Introduces `PoolCreationError` enum to represent failure cases  
   - Example: `ZeroSize` error for invalid pool sizes  

3. **Safe and Functional Worker Creation**  
   - Uses `.map().collect()` instead of a manual loop for cleaner code  

4. **Comparison: `new` vs. `build`**  
   - `new()`: Uses `assert!`, panics on invalid input (for programming errors)  
   - `build()`: Returns `Result`, allowing failures to be handled explicitly  

#### **Code Changes:**  

**New `build` Function:**  
```rust
pub fn build(size: usize) -> Result<ThreadPool, PoolCreationError> {
    if size == 0 {
        return Err(PoolCreationError::ZeroSize);
    }

    let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
    let receiver = Arc::new(Mutex::new(receiver));
    let workers = (0..size)
         .map(|id| Worker::new(id, Arc::clone(&receiver)))
         .collect::<Vec<Worker>>();

    Ok(ThreadPool { workers, sender })
}
```

**Updated `main.rs` Usage:**  
```rust
let pool = ThreadPool::build(4).expect("Failed to create ThreadPool!");
```

**New Error Type:**  
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
pub enum PoolCreationError {
    ZeroSize,
}
```

#### **Final Improvements:**  
- Implements Rustâ€™s `Result`-based error handling  
- Prevents unnecessary panics with structured failure cases  
- Maintains efficient multi-threading while adding robustness  

This approach provides a safer, more scalable way to manage **ThreadPool** initialization, ensuring errors can be handled gracefully without sacrificing performance.
